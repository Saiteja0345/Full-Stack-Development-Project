              I am an engineering student in the fourth year of Artificial Intelligence
              at the Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Chennai, Tamil Nadu.
              <br /> Through my engineering studies, I acquired strong skills in
              the field of software engineering. The various projects and that I have carried out have enabled me to develop not
              only my hard skills but also my soft skills.
              <br /> Motivated, I know how to adapt, I have a sense of
              responsibility and organization.
              <br/>I have interest in problem solving and developing softwares.
              <br/> Happy Coding :)
